# Cyclistic-Divvy-Bike-Share_Analysis
Project Scenerio:

*Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago. 
*The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. 
*Therefore, as a junior data analyst in the data analytics team, I wanted to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, the team will help the marketing team design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
*The Cyclistic’s historical trip data of the year 2021 was used for this analysis to analyze and identify trends.
