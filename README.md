# Cyclistic-Divvy-Bike-Share-Analysis
Project Scenerio:

*Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago. 

*The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. 

*As a data analyst in the data analytics team, I was tasked to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently by analysing and identify trends in historical bike-share 2021 trips data. 

*I backed up my analysis with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations for 	cyclistic executives to approve my recommendations.	

*From these insights drawn, I made recommendations that help marketing team design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
